# git clone

Cloning a repository is the act of creating a new directory and an associated copy of the remote repository. It will be a clone, meaning it has all tracked commits and commits history.

It wil also be associated with the remote, meaning that you can use the `git pull` command to pull updated from the original repository.

It can be done witht the `git clone` command as seen here:

```
git clone https://github.om/ElevenfiftyAcademy/TerminalDungeon.git
```
